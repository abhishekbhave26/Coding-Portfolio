Once the OTP is received on the email,enter it into the prompt and it checks or authenticates the user.

To run this application open any IDE like Eclipse,Netbeans or IntelliJ and create a Java project .Add the OTP_Generator.java file.
Add the mail.jar and activator.jar as external libraries.
Make appropriate changes in the sender's email id 
Lastly use the WAMP server as local host to host the application.
